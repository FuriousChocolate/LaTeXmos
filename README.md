# LaTeXmos
Converts LaTeX that is normally not in Desmos (such as mutiline expressions, limits, matrices, etc.) into LaTeX that can be pasted into a Desmos expression line.

## Usage
download ```LaTeX_to_Desmos.js``` and make an ```input.txt``` file in the same directory as it. Run ```node LaTeX_to_Desmos.js``` and you will see an output in terminal. Paste this into Desmos and yo're done!
